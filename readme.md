# Vasteroids
Vasteroids is a clone of the Asteroids game written in V. This is
the first game I've ever written, so please feel free to contribute
or point out things you would've done differently.

NOTE: Controls are UP to accellerate, LEFT and RIGHT to turn, X to fire, Z to teleport, and ESCAPE to pause game.

### TODO
- [x] Single player original game mode.
- [ ] Online last man standing game mode.
- [ ] More difficulty settings. Something like asteroid splits into 4 chunks instead of the default 2. Or only spaceships spawn instead of asteroids. Limited ammo? No teleporting? Only teleporting (i.e. no accelerating)? Heat-seeking asteroids?
