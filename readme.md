# Vasteroids
Vasteroids is a clone of the Asteroids game written in V. This is the first game I've ever written, so please feel free to contribute or point out things you would've done differently.

### TODO
- [ ] Single player original gamemode.
- [ ] Online last man standing game mode.
- [ ] More difficulty settings. Something like asteroid splits into 4 chunks instead of the default 2. Or only spaceships spawn instead of asteroids. Limited ammo? No teleporting? Only teleporting (i.e. no accelerating)? Heat-seeking asteroids?
